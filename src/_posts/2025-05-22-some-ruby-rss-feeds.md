I will eventually find a more permanent home for these, but I'm collecting RSS feeds from folks who post about Ruby at least occasionally, in the hopes that I can share more good stuff via [Ruby + Rails : Distilled](https://ruby.social/@distilled).

Here's the ones I've found so far, please feel free to email **gregory@skillstopractice.com** or reply to the Distilled account on Mastodon and I'll add yours if it looks like a fit.

As for my own posts, I've not yet got a Ruby-specific blog set up but my [general purpose notes feed is here](notes.skillstopractice.com/feed.xml).
